    mechanism: 'Oral covalent Bruton\'s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that blocks FceRI-mediated mast cell and basophil degranulation, reducing histamine and inflammatory mediator release',

    key_data: 'REMIX-1 and REMIX-2 Phase 3: UAS7 reduction significantly greater with remibrutinib 25 mg BID vs placebo at week 12 (p<0.001); ~55% achieved well-controlled disease (UAS7 <=6)',

    strengths: [
      'First-in-class oral BTK inhibitor for CSU offering a fundamentally new mechanism beyond anti-IgE',
      'Oral twice-daily dosing eliminates injection burden providing major convenience advantage over omalizumab',
      'Positive Phase 3 results with robust response rates and well-controlled disease in ~55% of patients',
    ],
    weaknesses: [
      'BTK inhibitor class carries theoretical risks of bleeding, infections, and hepatotoxicity requiring monitoring',
      'Twice-daily dosing less convenient than once-daily oral alternatives if they emerge',
      'Must demonstrate long-term safety to compete with well-established omalizumab safety profile in a chronic condition',
